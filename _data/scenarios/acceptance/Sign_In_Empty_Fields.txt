I WANT TO LOGIN TO WEBSITE

I am 'user' 
I look forward to 'access website features for logged-in users' 
I am on page '/' 
I see link 'Войти' 
I click '#myModal a' 
I fill field 'userlogin','' 
I fill field 'userpassword','' 
I click 'Войти'," ['class' => 'btn--auth-submit']" 
I expect 'the form is not submitted' 
I don't see 'Здравствуйте"," '," '.auth-user__hello'
